# Debrief -- Project Handover

The pipeline is complete. Produce a plain-English summary of what was built.
Think of this as a commissioning report handed over at the end of a project.

## What to do

Read the final state of the workspace to confirm what actually exists on disk.

Before producing the debrief, update the living docs:
- `docs/architecture.md` -- add/remove files if the module structure changed.
- `docs/decisions.md` -- append one entry per non-obvious decision made.
- `docs/roadmap.md` -- move completed items to the Done section.

Then produce the debrief in this format:

---
## Project Complete

### What was built
[2-4 sentences in plain English. Written as if explaining to someone who
wasn't in the room. No code.]

### How to use it
[Step-by-step. Assume the user has never run a terminal command.
Include exact commands where needed.]

### What was tested
[Plain-English list of what the tests verified. No code -- just sentences.]

### Known limitations
[Honest list of what the current version does NOT handle.]

### Suggested next steps (optional)
[Only include if there are genuine suggestions. Do not pad.]
---

End with: "Let me know if anything needs adjusting, or describe a new
problem to start again."

## Documentation Sync

When code changes during any pipeline stage, check whether these docs
need updating:

**Always update:**
- Plugin/project README.md -- feature list, usage instructions.
- Code docstrings and comments.
- `docs/architecture.md` -- if files were added, renamed, or deleted.

**Update if changed:**
- `docs/roadmap.md` -- if a planned feature was completed.
- `docs/decisions.md` -- if a non-obvious choice was made.
- API documentation -- if endpoints changed.

**Rules:**
- Update docs in the same commit as the code change.
- Do not create new doc files unless the user asks for them.
- Keep docs factual -- describe what IS, not what SHOULD BE.

## Rules
- No code unless it is a command the user needs to type to run something.
- Do not reopen design questions or suggest architectural changes.
- Be honest about limitations -- do not oversell what was built.
- Keep it to one readable page.
